PROPMT: In 1995 a member of the synthpop band Depeche Mode called it quits. Some fans still feel despondent about him leaving the band. Why is that (hint: what were his greatest contributions to the success of the band)? 
ANSWER: Fans of Depeche Mode were despondent and still feel a sense of loss when member Alan Wilder left the band in 1995. Wilder was a multi-instrumentalist and crucial behind-the-scenes figure, responsible for shaping the band's sound and contributing to its success.

Wilder joined Depeche Mode in 1982, replacing original member Vince Clarke. He quickly became an integral part of the band, playing a variety of instruments such as keyboards, drums, and the occasional guitar. He also brought a technical knowledge to the group, having studied sound engineering prior to joining Depeche Mode.

PROPMT: Last summer we went to the beach on lake Michigan. It was a windy day and the waves were huge. There was a warning posted on the beach, warning the swimmers of something. What was the warning?
ANSWER: I’m not sure if this is what the warning was about, but I think it should have been. The waves were so big that they were dragging people out to sea. Even though there were lifeguards on duty, they couldn’t do anything because the waves were too strong.

The only way to get back to shore was to swim against the current. And even then, you had to be careful not to get caught in an undertow.

If you’ve ever been caught in an undertow, you know how terrifying it can be. You feel like you’re being pulled
