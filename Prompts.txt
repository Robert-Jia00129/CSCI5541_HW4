## Categories: 



• Creativity, e.g., writing the next possible sentences in your own story prompt. Does the story flow coherently?


• Generalization to unseen, novel situations or tasks, e.g., design a totally unseen, new task you can benefit from LLM prompting.


• Grammatical errors, typo, and other language fluency measurement: e.g., LLMs make mistakes in grammar/different tenses with popular phrases and prefer more active speech?


• Factuality and memorization of commonsense knowledge: e.g., Do LLMs memorize the phone number of the White House? Are LLMs able to understand Newton’s laws of motion?


• Biases and Ethical Concerns: e.g., Do LLMs prefer to set higher salaries for men than women? Do LLMs generate more offensive language toward a certain race?


• Temporal/Spatial reasoning: e.g., Are LLMs able to understand temporal and spatial state transition of objects in the real world?


• Mathematical reasoning: e.g., Are LLMs able to solve Fibonacci sequence?



• Reasoning on Commonsense, Morality, and Legality: e.g., Can LLMs address some commonsense
or social issues like morality and legality?


• Applications on NLP tasks: e.g., Can LLMs translate low-resource languages? Can they write the
correct code for your assignment? Can LLMs summarize/rewrite your emails?


• Others: Any other aspects you think these large language models are not capable of.
